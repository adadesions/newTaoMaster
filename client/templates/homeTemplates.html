        <h3>Tai Chi Qi Gong 1</h3>
        <p>
        Tai Chi Chi Kung 1 consists of thirteen movements which are performed in all the four directions, clockwise and counterclockwise. In the practice of Tai Chi Chi Kung, the increased energy flow developed through the Microcosmic Orbit, Fusion work, Iron Shirt, Tao Yin and Tan Tien Chi Kung practices are integrated into one unified movement, so that the body learns more efficient ways of utilizing energy in motion.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Improper body movements restrict energy flow causing energy blockages, poor posture, and, in some cases, serious illness. Quite often, back problems are the result of improper posture, accumulated tension, weakened bone structure, and psychological stress. One result of increased body awareness through movement is an increased awareness of one’s environment and the potentials it contains.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Since Tai Chi is a gentle way of exercising and keeping the body fit, it can be practiced well into advanced age because the movements do not strain one’s physical capacity as some aerobic exercises do.

        <h3>Internal Organ Massage</h3>
        <p>Internal Organ Qi Massage techniques are used directly over the navel and surrounding abdominal areas where stress, tension and negative emotions accumulate.</p>
        <p>The Qi, life-force energy, moves through the body’s internal channels, nervous system, blood vessels, and lymph glands. These systems concentrate and cross paths in the abdomen, which acts as their control center. Tensions, worries, and stresses of the day, month, or year accumulate and are seldom dispersed. These disturbances can cause physical tangling and knotting of the nerves, blood vessels, and lymph nodes. The result is the gradual obstruction of energy circulation, which may lead to any number of maladies including, but not limited to, indigestion, constipation, bloating, insomnia, whole body toxicity, poor skin quality, and an inability to lose weight.</p>
        <p>The ancient Taoists realized that negative emotions cause serious damage to one’s health, impairing both physical and spiritual functions. They understood that each human emotion is an expression of energy and that certain emotions could indicate the negative energy behind many physical ailments. They also identified a specific cycle of relationships between the emotions and the organs. For example, the experience of a “knot” in one’s stomach indicated the presence of worry, the negative emotion that accumulates in the stomach and spleen.</p>
        <p>By using the technic of this special massage we can release and dissolve all the knot and energy blockage stuck in the various internal organs.</p>

In Guasha the practitioner uses a stroking action to methodically apply pressure to the skin with a specialized round-ended instrument. This technique causes small red or purple spots as reaction of the skin. The skin is not damaged in any way and the redness fades in a few days. Guasha is used to move blocked "Qi" (energy), which is considered to be the main cause of pain and stiffness in muscles and joints.</p>

          <div class="ui header">Inner Smile</div>
          <p>Inner Smile practice teaches you how to get in touch with your internal organs, smiling to them, and transforming them into love, kindness, gentleness, and healing energy.
By smiling to the organs and thanking them for the work they do, eventually we will reawaken the intelligence of the body. We are often so out of touch with our bodies and emotions that we do not notice inner disharmony developing until it finally manifests itself as a serious illness.
The Inner Smile is a powerful internal healing and relaxation meditation. Deep relaxation dissolves physical and mental tensions that can cause energy blockages and unhealthy Chi.
The Inner Smile enhances the energy of the organs and glands, our life force (Qi) in general, and develops the inner connections between mind and internal organs.
It makes us more aware of our body and inner being, because we learn to communicate with our organs, glands, spinal cord and other specific parts of our body, as well as our soul.
Practicing the Inner Smile daily provides a regular scheduled time to look inside, to keep in touch with the state of our inner organs, our Qi, our breath and our emotions.
Taoists discovered that consciousness is rooted not only in the brain alone, but also in the vital organs and in the more subtle sense in each of the cells.</p>
          <p>Inner Smile practice has many level, starting with a simple connection between internal organs, going to a complete internal-external harmony of vibrations and colors.</p>

          <p>Thousands of years ago Taoist Masters discovered in their meditations that each of the 6 organs has different living vibration that can be ear as sound. They discover even that when the organ sick, this vibration change, changing the sound that each organ emit. </p>
          <p>The practice of the “6 Healing Sounds”, work on keeping the correct vibration and frequencies to keep the organs in optimal condition by preventing and alleviating illness. To accompany the “6 Healing Sounds” practice, 6 accompanying postures were developed to activate the acupuncture meridians, or energy channels, of the organs.</p>
          <p>Detoxification through the “6 Healing Sounds” practice is so far is one of the best ways to clean out the organs, because it employs fresh energy to clean them. People spend a lot of money for herbs and drugs in order to cleanse and detoxify the organs. A lot of times people will experience moving of gas, or loose or very bad smelling bowel movements; these also are indications of ongoing detoxification.</p>
          <p>The Best Detoxification is through your own Life Force</p>

          <p>Each new practice is dependent upon the high quality of your meditations and your ability to perfect the Microcosmic Orbit. </p>
          <p>The Microcosmic Orbit Meditation awakens, circulates and directs Chi through the “Governator Channel”, which ascends from the base of the spine up to the head and the “Functional Channel”, which runs from the tip of the tongue down the middle of the torso to the perineum.</p>
          <p>The meditations of the Microcosmic Orbit strengthen the 'Original Chi' and teach you the basics of circulating Chi. They allow the palms, the soles of the feet, the mideyebrow point and the crown to open. These specific locations are the major points there energy can be absorbed, condensed and transformed into fresh new life force.</p>

          <p>The Empty Force is another practice of the Tao KungFu System that works using the saliva to collect and move the Qi energy in the body.</p>
          <p>The Taoists know that saliva is the fountain of life and mix it with Qi they called “Golden Elixir”. </p>
          <p>It is recognized by western scientists to be an extremely complex fluid containing a huge quantity of substances that keep our health in a perfect condition.</p>
          <p>Saliva has a role in digestion, electrolyte balance, and control of our oral micro flora, tissue maintenance, enamel maturation, acid neutralization and behavior. Its functions include moistening of oral tissues, protecting teeth from cavities, aiding speech, acting as a solvent necessary for taste and as a wetting agent to facilitate swallowing.</p>
          <p>Golden Elixir, also known as nectar, is the fountain of life or water of life. This is the mixture of saliva, other hormonal fluids and external essences that, when mixed, becomes the Elixir. Taoists believe that this Elixir is a major transformer for the higher spiritual work, and has the power to heal many diseases. Some Taoist texts recommend swallowing the saliva up to 1,000 times a day for spiritual work and healing.</p>

          <p>The purification of stem cells taken from umbilical cord blood, allows scientists to research the function of the immune system and to develop treatments for diseases such AIDS and leukemia.</p>
          <p>Stem cells can be found in adult human beings. Adult stem cells reproduce daily to provide certain specialized cells - for example 200 billion red blood cells are created each day in the body. Until recently it was thought that each of these cells could produce just one particular type of cell - this is called differentiation however in the past few years, evidence has been gathered of stem cells that can transform into several different forms. Bone marrow stem cells are known to be able to transform into liver, nerve, muscle and kidney cells. </p>
          <p>Useful sources of adult stem cells are being found in organs all over the body. Researchers have extracted stem cells from skin that are able to differentiate into many types of tissue, including neurons, smooth muscle cells and fat-cells. In this special technique we stimulate the body to keep producing the stem cells by drawing the Qi in our body and hitting the body and the internal organs.</p>

          <p>Women lose little sexual energy through orgasm, but instead lose it primarily through menstruation and childbearing. The sexual guidance and exercises presented are being introduced plainly to the Western public for the first time.</p>
          <p>For thousands of years Taoist masters taught these secrets only to very small numbers of people in the royal courts and in esoteric circles, who were sworn to silence. These are the 3 main practices that women can use to cultivate and enhance their sexual energy: the Ovarian Breathing, Breast Massage and the Orgasmic Upward Draw. When this practice is mastered one can experience a total body orgasm that is beyond ordinary vaginal orgasm without losing life-force energy.</p>
          <p>A series of exercises with a jade or stone egg is used to strengthen the urogenital and pelvic diaphragm, the muscles of the vagina and the glands, tendons and nervous system. The practice can shorten menstruation, reduce cramps and compress more life force energy (Chi) into the ovaries for more sexual and creative power.</p>

          <div class="ui header">Fusion of the 5 Elements 1</div>
          <p>Fusion of the Five Elements is the first level of meditation in a Taoist practice also known as Fusion of the Five Forces in the Universe. It is the beginning of Inner Alchemy, a scientific process by which you gain control over the energies of your inner universe so that a connection can be made to the tremendous energy of the universe beyond the body.</p>
          <p>This energy becomes useful for self-healing, day-to-day living and reaching spiritual goals. The Fusion meditation is the first step in learning to control the generation and flow of emotional, mental and physical energies within your body. The practice teaches you how to locate and dissolve the negative energies hidden inside your body.</p>
          <p>Using the Taoist Five Element Theory, a connection is made between the five outer senses - eyes, tongue, mouth, nose, ears - and the Five major emotions - anger, hate, worry, sadness, and fear. O­nce the negative emotion is identified with the organ it is stored in, it can be controlled.</p>
          <p>The Fusion meditation shows you step by step how the negative emotions are removed from the organs.</p>
          <p>Negative emotions are neither suppressed nor expressed. Instead, their negative energy is brought to specific points in the body where it is easily neutralized, purified, and then transformed back into your original positive, creative energy. The great secret of crystallizing and storing your original positive energy in a mysterious pearl is revealed for the first time in the Fusion alchemical formula.</p>
          <p>This pearl is the essence of our life force energy, or Chi. It is central to nourishing the physical body, and later to nourishing the soul, or energy body. In more advanced Fusion practice, your soul/energy body becomes very controllable and its power can be balanced, strengthened and expanded to connect with the essence of the Earth and Star energies. The Fusion of the Five Elements practice is the essential first step toward complete emotional and spiritual development.</p>

          <p>The Nine Hand Seals Technique and its related teachings have their origins in the Hindu religion where they were initially used by a few groups from the lower castes. These mystical techniques were a means used by the monks to bring the virtues of the spirit into mundane experience. The original form was not as developed as the system we have today. Thus, this historical perspective refers to the origins of the current system, not the modern Nine Hand Seals Technique as it exists today. Buddhism came out of Hinduism, and, with it, the Nine Hand Seals Technique became ever more popular. The original mudras remain the same as those taught in ancient times, but Buddhist mantras were also added to the system to enhance it. The original mantras were in Sanskrit.</p>
          <p>The Buddhist movement later traveled to China, where the tradition was passed on to the hermetic and esoteric groups there. Boa Pu Zhi, a wise Chinese master, was the first to put the nine hand mudras on paper, in his work published around the 3rd century AC. Eventually, the techniques migrated to Japan, along with esoteric Buddhism, where the mantras were translated into Japanese phonetics.</p>
          <p>The modern Kuji-In technique is composed of a ritual process comprising the traditional application of the Buddhist “three secrets” (mudra, mantra, and mandala). The true Kuji-In secret lies within the contemplation of that philosophy which we use to change our attitude about life.</p>
