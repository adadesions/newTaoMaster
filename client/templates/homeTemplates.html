        <h3>Tai Chi Qi Gong 1</h3>
        <p>
        Tai Chi Chi Kung 1 consists of thirteen movements which are performed in all the four directions, clockwise and counterclockwise. In the practice of Tai Chi Chi Kung, the increased energy flow developed through the Microcosmic Orbit, Fusion work, Iron Shirt, Tao Yin and Tan Tien Chi Kung practices are integrated into one unified movement, so that the body learns more efficient ways of utilizing energy in motion.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Improper body movements restrict energy flow causing energy blockages, poor posture, and, in some cases, serious illness. Quite often, back problems are the result of improper posture, accumulated tension, weakened bone structure, and psychological stress. One result of increased body awareness through movement is an increased awareness of one’s environment and the potentials it contains.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Since Tai Chi is a gentle way of exercising and keeping the body fit, it can be practiced well into advanced age because the movements do not strain one’s physical capacity as some aerobic exercises do.

        <h3>Internal Organ Massage</h3>
        <p>Internal Organ Qi Massage techniques are used directly over the navel and surrounding abdominal areas where stress, tension and negative emotions accumulate.</p>
        <p>The Qi, life-force energy, moves through the body’s internal channels, nervous system, blood vessels, and lymph glands. These systems concentrate and cross paths in the abdomen, which acts as their control center. Tensions, worries, and stresses of the day, month, or year accumulate and are seldom dispersed. These disturbances can cause physical tangling and knotting of the nerves, blood vessels, and lymph nodes. The result is the gradual obstruction of energy circulation, which may lead to any number of maladies including, but not limited to, indigestion, constipation, bloating, insomnia, whole body toxicity, poor skin quality, and an inability to lose weight.</p>
        <p>The ancient Taoists realized that negative emotions cause serious damage to one’s health, impairing both physical and spiritual functions. They understood that each human emotion is an expression of energy and that certain emotions could indicate the negative energy behind many physical ailments. They also identified a specific cycle of relationships between the emotions and the organs. For example, the experience of a “knot” in one’s stomach indicated the presence of worry, the negative emotion that accumulates in the stomach and spleen.</p>
        <p>By using the technic of this special massage we can release and dissolve all the knot and energy blockage stuck in the various internal organs.</p>

This technique causes small red or purple spots as reaction of the skin. The skin is not damaged in any way and the redness fades in a few days.
